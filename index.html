                <h2>Medieval (500 – 1400)</h2>
                <p>
                The tradition of Western classical music stretches all the way back from 500AD right
                up to the 20th and 21st Centuries and can be split into six main periods or eras. The
                Medieval period is the first of these and, at around 900 years in length, is by far
                the longest. This guide will look at some of its histories, key figures, and important
                musical features, to help give you an understanding of what makes a piece from this
                time sound the way it does. The music and composers of the Medieval period may not be
                as widely known, or as commonly performed, as those of later years, but the era is
                incredibly important for a number of reasons. As well as producing some beautiful music 
                –much of it written in a religious context – it saw some key theoretical and musical
                developments that laid the groundwork for the periods that were to follow.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The dominant form of music in the Early Medieval period was 
                Gregorian chant, which was named after Pope Gregory, who was credited with bringing it 
                to the West. Otherwise known as plainsong, it was liturgical, meaning that it was sung 
                by monks as a ceremonial part of Mass in the Catholic Church.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Medieval music was based upon a series of scales called modes whereby a melody would
                be built upon a particular scale. There were eight ‘church modes’, which were all 
                considered to have different effects upon the listener:
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorian
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypodorian (which we would now call Aeolian)
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phrygian
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypophrygian (which we now call Locrian)
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lydian                    <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypolydian (which we would call Ionian)
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixolydian

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypomixolydian (which is like a Dorian scale, but with the fourth degree as its ‘Finalis’, or ending note)
